In asynchronous Callback mode, the application side needs to pass the callback function. After the application side invokes the native interface, the native side executes the service logic asynchronously, without blocking the application side. For example, if the application side needs to read a file, in the asynchronous mode, the application side  does not wait for file reading from the native side to complete but continue to run.
