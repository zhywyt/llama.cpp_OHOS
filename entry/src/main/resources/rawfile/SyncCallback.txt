During synchronous tasks development, the main thread on the ArkTS application side waits for the calculation results, which is sent from the native side through the Ark engine. During this process, the Native code and the ArkTS application code run on the ArkTS main thread. For example, if the application side needs to read a file, in the synchronous mode, the application side waits until the file reading on the native side is complete before running.
